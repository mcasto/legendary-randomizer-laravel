☐ build a migration for a games table
    * id (autoinc primary key)
    * schemes (json)
    * masterminds (json)
    * villains (json)
    * henchmen (json)
    * heroes (json)
    * setup (json)

☐ build a Game model
    * candidates
    * deck
    ☐ build logic to build deck from candidates
    ☐ figure out how to manage handlers (code snippets to modify setup & deck), I think I want to do them as Controllers, but I'm not sure if that makes sense. That's our first topic of discussion for this session.
    ☐ build logic for handlers (these modify the setup & deck based on the parameters for the item they're associated with: usually schemes, occasionally a mastermind or villain [so far, might change with future expansions])
    ☐ make sure each element of the setup is fulfilled after the handlers run (e.g.: proper number of schemes, masterminds, villains, henchmen, heroes)
